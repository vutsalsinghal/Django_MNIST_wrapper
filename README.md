# Django_MNIST_wrapper

## Overview

This is a web app for MNIST dataset to classify/predict handwritten digits. Developed using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](http://keras.io/) Library. Wrapped into a Webapp using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Framework.

## Dependencies

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

Use of ```virtualenv``` is strongly suggested!

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run this to see it in your browser. 

```python manage.py runserver```

That's it! It's serving a saved Keras model to you via Django. 

## Credits

This code was inspired from [||Source||](https://github.com/llSourcell), who had created a [similar](https://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_deploy_a_keras_model_to_production) wrapper using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Micro Framework.
